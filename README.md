## Description

This project is a simple random word guessing game. It selects a random word from a predefined list of fruits and prompts the user to enter a single letter. The game checks if the input is valid (i.e., a single alphabetical character) and provides feedback accordingly. The aim of this project is to practice basic Python programming concepts, including user input, conditionals, and using the random module.

### What I Learned

- How to use the `random` module in Python to select a random element from a list.
- How to handle user input and validate it using conditionals.
- Basic error handling and user feedback.
