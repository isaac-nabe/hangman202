## Description

This project is a simple random word guessing game. It selects a random word from a predefined list of fruits and prompts the user to enter a single letter. The game checks if the input is valid (i.e., a single alphabetical character) and whether the guessed letter is in the chosen word, providing appropriate feedback.

### What I Learned

- How to use the `random` module in Python to select a random element from a list.
- How to handle user input and validate it using conditionals.
- Basic error handling and user feedback.
- Encapsulation and modularization of code using functions.

## Installation Instructions

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the script using Python:
